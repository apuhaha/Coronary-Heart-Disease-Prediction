# Coronary-Heart-Disease-Prediction
### About
 Coronary Heart Disease, or Coronary Artery Disease, develops when thw coronary arteries become too narrow or cholesterol blockages develop in the walls.  This can sometimes lead to a heart attack. It is the most common type of heart disease.
 An ML classification model based on the attributes that cause this disease can help determine the risk an thus help in increasing the survival rate of the patients.
 
### Dataset
  The dataset has attribute columns that determine the risk of having cervical cancer. The dataset has 34281 rows and 25 columns. 
The columns are- 
 * 'ID'   * 'A10'
 * 'IV'   * 'A11'
 * 'A1'   * 'A12'
 * 'A2'   * 'A13'
 * 'A3'   * 'A14'
 * 'A4'   * 'A15'
 * 'A5'   * 'A16'
 * 'A6'   * 'A17'
 * 'A7'   * 'A18'
 * 'A8'   * 'A19'
 * 'A9'   * 'A20'
 * 'A20'  * 'A22'
 * 'Target'   
      
###CONCLUSION:
* We see that the columns A4, A13,A14,A19 have some significant correlation coefficient with the target variable.
* The column A11 has no relation with any other column.
* We find a significant correlation between some of the columns like-A5 and A6, A12 an A9, etc.
